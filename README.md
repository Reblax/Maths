# Maths

This is Reblax's math github repository. Some things are in English, some are in French.

## Currently, in English
- Homology theory lecture notes (original notes by Baptiste Rognerud)
- Solutions to some problems in Wedhorn's Manifolds, Sheaves and Cohomology
- Solutions to some problems in Vakil's Rising Sea
- Linear algebra notes (Kind of a Linear Algebra Done My Way book, in spirit? Idk it's just a fun project, doing some easier math, much more teaching-focused)

## Upcoming, in English
- Solutions to some problems in Milnor and Stasheff's Characteristic Classes
- Solutions to some problems in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology
- I should probably try to understand where the proof of quadratic reciprocity comes from but i am not a number theorist and that's just a cool thingie i'd like to do at one point but maybe i'll end up never doing it so don't count on it

## Currently, in French
- Notes d'algèbre 2 (théorie des corps/anneaux, cours de Vlerë Mehmeti)
- Quelques solutions de TD de Variétés Algébriques (cours de Jean-François Dat)
- Note d'un exposé pour un groupe de travail (elles sont pas bien, ne les lisez pas)
- Une calcul sans revêtements du pi_1 du cercle (commencé mais incomplet pour l'instant)

## Upcoming, in French
- Cohomologie des espaces projectifs
- Dualité de Poincaré
